with childhood type 1 diabetes mellitusrevealed by a long questionnaire on early life exposures and lifestyle 
in a case-control study, BMC Public Health 16.

For the above dataset only a subset of patients and a subset of questionnaire survey items were chosen.  The patients and features were randomly shuffled to hide their identities.  

The main script for generating the AUC curves is mainAUCwithprod.m
The main script for generating the PR curves is mainPRwithprod.m

In both the above scripts, make sure the data directory is replaced by the name of the directory where your file is placed.
